# Finding patterns in traffic accidents in Madrid using unsupervised machine learning methods

## Description
The aim of this project is to extract relevant information about the conditions under which accidents occur in Madrid, such as the effect of rain, specific locations, or certain types of vehicles.

**Note:** The project has been developed in Spanish.

## Project Structure
The work is structured in the following documents:
```
├── 1_jerarquico.ipynb       # Contains the descriptive analysis of the dataset and the application of hierarchical clustering.
├── 2_particional.ipynb      # Implements and analyzes partitional clustering algorithms.
├── 3_densidad.ipynb         # Implements density-based clustering algorithms.
├── memoria.pdf              # A document detailing the work carried out.
```

## Implementation Steps
### 1. Hierarchical Clustering (1_jerarquico.ipynb)
- Descriptive analysis and preprocessing of the dataset.
- Application of at least two hierarchical clustering algorithms with different distance metrics.
- Analysis of the dendrogram structure.
- Evaluation of clustering quality using different indices.
- Determination of the optimal number of clusters.
- Identification of high-accident zones for different vehicle types using clustering methods.

### 2. Partitional Clustering (2_particional.ipynb)
- Data preprocessing.
- Estimation of the optimal number of clusters using methods covered in the course.
- Evaluation of clustering quality based on the number of clusters.
- Comparison between K-means and hierarchical clustering.

### 3. Density-Based Clustering (3_densidad.ipynb)
- Data preprocessing.
- Selection of appropriate parameters (eps and minpoints).
- Evaluation of clustering quality with different configurations.
- Comparison of results and determination of the optimal number of clusters.
